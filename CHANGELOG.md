## 0.4.29 (05 May 2026)

- Transcripts: Treat directories with `.eval` files as an eval log collection (presence of `.parquet` no longer prevails).
- Dependencies: Sync to semaphore changes in Inspect v0.3.217.
- Bugfix: Exit non-zero when `--fail-on-error` and scan does not complete.
- Bugfix: Always reset text progress indicator when job completes.

## 0.4.28 (29 April 2026)

- LLM Scanner: Send default-template prompts as two content blocks (preamble + transcript / per-scanner tail) with `cache_prompt=True`. On Anthropic, the shared-prefix block is marked for caching so multiple scanners on the same transcript share a cache entry.
- LLM Scanner: `template` parameter accepts a `tuple[str, str]` of `(prefix, suffix)` to opt custom templates into the same two-block cache-aware rendering. Passing a single `str` keeps the legacy single-block behavior unchanged.
- Scanners: Run the first scanner alone for each transcript; release the rest only after it completes. Lets the lead's generate populate the prompt cache so followers hit the warm cache.
- Scanner as Scorer: When `Result.value` is `None` but the result includes an answer, explanation, or metadata, return a `NOANSWER` score that preserves those fields instead of dropping the score entirely.
- `generate_answer()` / `structured_generate()`: add `config: GenerateConfig | None` parameter for per-call overrides (e.g. `cache`), so callers no longer need to mutate or copy the role `Model` to set generation options. `parallel_tool_calls` remains forced to `False` for structured answers.
- Scout View: Improve message collapse behavior.
- Scout View: Fade out bottom of truncated expandable panels to indicate more content below.
- Scout View: Fix timeline error markers incorrectly flagging every model and tool event.
- Scout View: Store task list filter/sort state independently per scope (Tasks vs Folders, individual folders).
